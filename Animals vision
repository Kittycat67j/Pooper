from this day since i was 8 i wanted to know what pets actually feel, hear, think, and see i believe that a dog may just hear high
sounds and not low what if a cheetah fells bad for the gazelle it eats why should have the right to choose what animals think like 
people say dogs are only thinking stuff like yay yay yay but what if they actully have somthing else to think about... their life
